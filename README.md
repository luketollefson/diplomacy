Goals for changes 
New version: started 23 May 2020
Goals
     Simplify, especailly the following
         terminus finding (if possible), prehaps there is a fixpoint/endomap libray or math
         nextTurn, can logic be pulled out to be resued on top level?
         In nextTurn, the main part, can 84-108 be massivly simplified
     Renaming, give better and more descriptive names (as well as removing temporary names)
     Use data type more, see if things belong to typeclasses I might not do this right now, I don't fully know what the data for validation, water etc.
     Comment the reasoning
     Make imported things easier to use
Non-Goals
     Validation, I still don't know enough about the problem
Style
     don't get too wide or indented
     Use Transparent vs terse code
     Don't abuse abstractions
     Commits describe changes
 Math stuff
     Fixed point (discrete fixed point)
     Endomap
     Invariant Promising!
     Cycles and fixed points
     Periodic point
     Limit set (continous)
     Limit cycle (continuous)
